\title{Compute Owen-like Function \code{TOwen1(h, a)}}
\usage{
TOwen1(h, a, threads = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{h}{numeric vector of \eqn{h} arguments.}

\item{a}{numeric vector of \eqn{a} arguments. Must be either the same length as \code{h}
or of length 1 (it will be recycled to match \code{h}).}

\item{threads}{integer. Number of threads to request from the C implementation (if supported).
Default is \code{1}.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of length \code{length(h)} with the computed values. Elements
where either \code{h} or \code{a} is non-finite are \code{NA}. The returned
vector is given class \code{"snreg"} for downstream compatibility.
}
\description{
\code{TOwen1} computes an Owen's \eqn{T}-function variant (or a related
special function) for vectors \code{h} and \code{a} by delegating to a compiled
C routine named \code{"TOwen1"}. Non-finite inputs in \code{h} or \code{a}
yield \code{NA} at the corresponding positions.
}
\details{
Owen's T Function Variant via C Backend


This is a thin R wrapper around a native routine with signature:
\preformatted{
  void TOwen1(int *n, double *h, double *a, double *out, int *threads)
}
The C function is expected to fill \code{out[0..(*n-1)]} with results for
each pair \code{(h[i], a[i])}. The wrapper:
\itemize{
  \item Recycles \code{a} to match \code{length(h)} (standard R behavior).
  \item Computes values only for finite pairs; non-finite entries become \code{NA}.
  \item Forwards a \code{threads} hint to the C implementation.
}
}
\section{Linking to the C routine}{

Ensure the symbol \code{"TOwen1"} is available from your package's shared
object. With Roxygen2, include (once in your package):
\preformatted{
#' @useDynLib yourpkg, .registration = TRUE
NULL
}
and register the routine in \code{src/init.c}. If you are not using explicit
registration, \code{@useDynLib yourpkg} (without \code{.registration = TRUE})
will still allow \code{.C("TOwen1", ...)} provided the symbol is exported.
}

\examples{
\dontrun{
  # Requires compiled C routine "TOwen1":
  h <- c(-1, 0, 1, 2)
  a <- 0.3
  TOwen1(h, a)

  # Vectorized 'a' with non-finite entries:
  a2 <- c(0.2, NA, 1, Inf)
  TOwen1(h, a2)
}
